# Project-2-Spotify-API-App
This is the repository for Anthony DeVito's Spotify Web Player project. This project fills a need for me: I wanted a way that would artistically display an albums artwork and relevant song information on a big, static screen, such as my living room tv. This does that!

This application displays currently playing Spotify track information (such as song, artist, album and artwork, as well as current location in the song) and some limited control functionality (play, pause, skip, etc).
