# Project-2-Spotify-API-App
This is the repository for Anthony DeVito's Spotify Web Player project. This project fills a need for me: I wanted a way that would artistically display an album's artwork and relevant song information on a big, static screen (such as a living room tv). This does that!

This application displays currently playing Spotify track information (such as song, artist, album and artwork, as well as current location in the song) and some limited control functionality (play, pause, skip, etc).
